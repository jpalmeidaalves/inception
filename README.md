# Inception

Embarking on a 42 project dedicated to mastering Docker and Docker-compose, the task at hand is to construct a structure to serve a wordpress site with three Docker containers. One container hosts Nginx, another accommodates Wordpress, while the third houses MariaDB. The ultimate aim is to orchestrate seamless collaboration among these containers over the Docker network, culminating in the display of a functioning local website.
